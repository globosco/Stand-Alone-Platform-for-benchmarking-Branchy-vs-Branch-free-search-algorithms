## Datasets

Datasets used in this work can be downloaded at https://osf.io/ygnw8/?view_only=f531d074c25b4d3c92df6aec97558b39
All downloaded files must be placed in the data folder located in the repository root before running the benchmark scripts.

## Prerequisites

In order to execute this benchmark, you have to download rmi data folder from ... and copy it in the repository root.

## Usage instructions

We provide a number of scripts to automate things. Each is located in the `scripts` directory, but should be executed from the repository root.

### Running the benchmark

* `./scripts/compile.sh` compiles the benchmark
* `./scripts/execute_search_all.sh` executes the benchmark using all the search methods used in the work without Learned Index, storing the results in `results`. This script returns the results as csv files.
* `./scripts/execute_best_all.sh` executes the benchmark using all the search methods used in the work with the best performing Learned Indexes, storing the results in `results`. This script returns the results as csv files.
